h1 Jadedown

(http://jadedown.com)[Jadedown] is a lightweight markup language based on (http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/)[Markdown] and (http://jade-lang.org)[Jade].

h2 Overview

# Tags take the form: `tagName#id.class1.class2(attr1="value", attr2="value 2")[innerHTLM]`
# If a line starts with a recognised tag, then the line is wrapped in that tag.  For example: `h3 This is a header`
# If a line starts with `*` or `#` it is a unordered or ordered list
# There is also shorthand for commonly used tags, like strong, em, links, and code

h2 Jade Influences

In Jade, a tag is written at the start of a line:

<pre>
h3 This is a header
</pre>

This has been retained in Jadedown.

Jade uses CSS selectors and brackets to contain attributes:

<pre>
h3.className(style="color: blue") This is a header
</pre>

Jadedown uses the same conventions.

h2 Shorthand

* Code can be written with backticks <code>`var a = 1;`</code>
* Asterisks and underscores are used for bold and italic
* Other lines are converted to paragraphs
* Unordered lists start with asterisks
* Ordered lists start with a hash

h2 Plans

# Inline tags
# Tags with classes
# Tags with IDs
# Full test suite
